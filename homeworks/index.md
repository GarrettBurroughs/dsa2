We will be using [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) for this course. Check out the [Gradescope Information Page](./gradescope.html) for information on how to submit programming assignments to Gradescope.

That page also explains how the score reported by Gradescope translates to the two-level scale of *Incomplete, and Pass* that is used in this course.
